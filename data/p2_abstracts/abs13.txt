As an important part of modern health care, medical imaging data, which can be
regarded as densely sampled functional data, have been widely used for diagnosis,
screening, treatment, and prognosis, such as finding breast cancer through
mammograms. The aim of this paper is to propose a functional linear regression
model for using functional (or imaging) predictors to predict clinical outcomes
(e.g., disease status), while addressing missing clinical outcomes. We introduce 
an exponential tilting semiparametric model to account for the nonignorable
missing data mechanism. We develop a set of estimating equations and its
associated computational methods for both parameter estimation and the selection 
of the tuning parameters. We also propose a bootstrap resampling procedure for
carrying out statistical inference. Under some regularity conditions, we
systematically establish the asymptotic properties (e.g., consistency and
convergence rate) of the estimates calculated from the proposed estimating
equations. Simulation studies and a real data analysis are used to illustrate the
finite sample performance of the proposed methods.
